    greeting: What's a dwarf to do with a rock in his shoe, a knot in his beard and some cold turnip stew?
    background: I served as a blaster in the Skysinger guild. Good job until I started seeing shapes moving in every dark patch I looked. Since I got out of delving I've made a living foraging for artifacts in the West.
