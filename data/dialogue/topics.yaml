  default:
    text: You'll find them occasionally throughout southern Hamaeron, though they aren't a native plant. I hear they lure small animals in with their sweet scent, and snare them in their ooze. The locals say they have healing properties.
delvers:
  locked: true 
  default: 
    text: They're state sanctioned relic hunters. They pick through ruins, barrows and crypts for salvage from the ancients. They're an odd bunch, and most keep away from them.
  groups:
    delvers: 
      threshold: 0.4
      text: Between the bitter smell of powder and the contempt for surface dwellers the average citizen keeps away from us. They haven't seen what we've seen... how could they understand what we do? Let them judge.
  people:
    ruricHcvungylr:
      threshold: 0.6
      text: We dig into the ruins of the ancients to find the glorious treasures of the dead world. I've seen strange things under this old ground. Good trade to ply for a dwarf, all in all. The men fare less well - I'd stay away from them if you see them.
dwarves:
  locked: false 
  default:
    text: Short stocky folk, seems like few know where they're from, and they mostly keep to themselves. They look sort of like rocks, if you see them in the right light.
  groups:
    dwarves:
      threshold: 0.5
      text: We're an old race, with a long memory. If you come by a dwarven encampment, sit by the fire if you're invited to, and listen to the song. You'll learn something, human.
Hamaeron:
  locked: false 
  default:
    text: The westernmost province of the Empire is also its most remote. A few settlements are scattered amongst the sea bluffs and highlands, but most of the province can scarcely be claimed as Imperial. There are certainly other things that claim dominion over this land, however, and the northern reaches of Hamaeron hold no sanctuary for travellers. 
Lockeshead:
  locked: false 
  default:
    text: The largest town in Hamaeron, and if you want any civilized amenities it's your best chance of finding them. It's a hub for delving, and several of the guilds have outposts in the town. You'll find the money in the eastern quarter of town - but the western quarter is more fun. If you're not affiliated with a guild, you can always go see Shuki for work.
  unlocks:
    - delvers
    - Shuki
    - The Skysingers
Korakorum:
  locked: false 
  default:
    text: An ancient fortress above the great ocean. Last I heard, delvers hadn't been able to break into it beyond a few antechambers. Perhaps thats for the best.
  unlocks:
    - delvers
Shuki:
  locked: true
  default:
    text: Shuki is a bartender in the southern slum of Lockeshead. Some say her business goes beyond that of an innkeep, but I wouldn't mention that around her. If you do go visit, look for the fat, booming Feneziri woman, you can't miss her.
  people:
    ruricHcvungylr:
      text: Shuki has quite the reputation in this part of the world. Some would have you believe her power rivals that of the Empire. All I know is, she serves a good drink, and can get you work if you need it... and lack certain scruples.
The Skysingers:
  locked: true 
  default: 
    text: The Skysingers are the official delver guild of Lord Amond Grey, which makes them the de facto delver guild of the Empire. They generally enjoy first contracts on new delver sites and access to the best equipment, though I've heard they lack the talent of other guilds. Too many lord's sons trying to make a name for themselves, not enough real wit.
  groups:
    skysingers: 
      threshold: 0
      text: We're the pride of the Empire. Our Lord guarantees us the best men, equipment and sites, and in return, we glorify him with the treasures our delves unearth. 
  unlocks:
    - delvers
Talion Flower:
  conditions:
    inInventory: true
  default:
    text: A simple white flower that grows near the sea in the West. Their smell tingles the nostrils, though don't eat them - they'll make you woozy.
The Grey Empire:
  default:
    text: The Empire is old, with its roots in the first empire of man, Avanthum. For hundreds of years, it has fought against the wilds, rebellion, and forces of evil in order to colonize and expand into new territory. Many of these colonies do not last, though, and fall into ruin or disappear altogether. The Grey Empire has claimed half the world - in turn, the world claimed half of it back.
  people:
    ruricHcvungylr:
      text: The Grey Lineage would have you believe they're the mightiest empire in the world. I hear news from dwarves roaming through these parts that another human empire is growing in the East. They spread like a disease under black banners, goaded on by howling priests. We shall see how mighty Grey is, when the Black comes to blot it out.
